# What?

A script with an underlying function for converting numbers to plain English

# Why?

So when I see a long number and wonder how to say it out loud I no longer need to count groups of three digits manually.  It's changed my life.

# How?

Comes with a simple command-line interface:

```
$ python num_string.py 213.412
213.412: two hundred and thirteen point four one two
```
